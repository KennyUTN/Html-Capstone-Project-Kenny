This Project is a variation of a Creative Commons Global Summit design  [Link Here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015), it consists of a conference page that has a main page, another page where you can buy tickets for the conference, and the 'About us' page that further describes the event.

Instead of a Conference, I designed the website to be for a music festival, the color palette was mostly respected but little tweaks where done to some parts of the design.

The website was mainly built using Bootstrap4 and some stylings were given with plain CSS.
